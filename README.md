# json.pictures

json.pictures is a super simple service designed to help you more easily test
your connections to third party JSON apis.

To use it, simply post the JSON response you want to the url you'd like to get
it from, then getting that url will return the response you posted.

### Notes

This is very much an MVP.
A few more features and capabilities will be coming in the future.
